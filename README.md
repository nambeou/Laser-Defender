# Laser-Defender
Simple Galazy Laser shooting game with Unity

This was made with the help from the "Learn Unity in C# & Code Your First Seven 2D Video Games" course on Udemy. Instructors are Rick Davidson and Ben Tristem.

Most part of the game followed the course's tutorial, with some modification on my part with whatever I could think of at the time of coding.

This repository is just a sample for anyone who wants to have a skeleton for their game, or their first attempt at creating a game with Unity.

Some screenshots from the game:
